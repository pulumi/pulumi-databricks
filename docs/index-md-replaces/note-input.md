-> **Note** If you experience technical difficulties with rolling out resources in this example, please make sure that [environment variables](#environment-variables) don't [conflict with other](#empty-provider-block) provider block attributes. When in doubt, please run `TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform apply` to enable [debug mode](https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/debugging.html) through the [`TF_LOG`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/config/environment-variables.html#tf_log) environment variable. Look specifically for `Explicit and implicit attributes` lines, that should indicate authentication attributes used.
