Legacy node types cannot specify custom EBS volumes. For node types with no instance store, at least one EBS volume needs to be specified; otherwise, cluster creation will fail. These EBS volumes will be mounted at /ebs0, /ebs1, and etc. Instance store volumes will be mounted at /local_disk0, /local_disk1, and etc. If EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use only the EBS volumes for scratch storage because heterogeneously sized scratch devices can lead to inefficient disk utilization. If no EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use instance store volumes. If EBS volumes are specified, then the Spark configuration spark.local.dir will be overridden.

Similarly, if this field is set to 200, the max price is twice the price of on-demand `i3.xlarge` instances. If not specified, the default value is `100`. When spot instances are requested for this cluster, only spot instances whose max price percentage matches this field will be considered. For safety, we enforce this field to be no more than `10000`.
