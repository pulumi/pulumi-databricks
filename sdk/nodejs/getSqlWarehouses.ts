 * Retrieves a list of databricks.SqlEndpoint ids, that were created by Pulumi or manually.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Retrieve IDs for all SQL warehouses:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const all = databricks.getSqlWarehouses({});
 * ```
 *
 * Retrieve IDs for all clusters having "Shared" in the warehouse name:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const allShared = databricks.getSqlWarehouses({
 *     warehouseNameContains: "shared",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Related Resources
 *
 * The following resources are often used in the same context:
 *
 * * End to end workspace management guide.
 * * databricks.InstanceProfile to manage AWS EC2 instance profiles that users can launch databricks.Cluster and access data, like databricks_mount.
 * * databricks.SqlDashboard to manage Databricks SQL [Dashboards](https://docs.databricks.com/sql/user/dashboards/index.html).
 * * databricks.SqlGlobalConfig to configure the security policy, databricks_instance_profile, and [data access properties](https://docs.databricks.com/sql/admin/data-access-configuration.html) for all databricks.getSqlWarehouse of workspace.
 * * databricks.SqlPermissions to manage data object access control lists in Databricks workspaces for things like tables, views, databases, and [more](https://docs.databricks.com/security/access-control/table-acls/object-privileges.html).
