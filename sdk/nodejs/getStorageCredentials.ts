 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * List all storage credentials in the metastore
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const all = databricks.getStorageCredentials({});

 *
 * ## Related Resources
 *
 * The following resources are used in the same context:
 *
 * * databricks.StorageCredential to get information about a single credential
 * * databricks.StorageCredential to manage Storage Credentials within Unity Catalog.
