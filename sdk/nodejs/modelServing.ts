/**
 * This resource allows you to manage [Model Serving](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/model-serving/index.html) endpoints in Databricks.
 *
 * > If you replace `servedModels` with `servedEntities` in an existing serving endpoint, the serving endpoint will briefly go into an update state (~30 seconds) and increment the config version.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const _this = new databricks.ModelServing("this", {
 *     name: "ads-serving-endpoint",
 *     config: {
 *         servedEntities: [
 *             {
 *                 name: "prod_model",
 *                 entityName: "ads-model",
 *                 entityVersion: "2",
 *                 workloadSize: "Small",
 *                 scaleToZeroEnabled: true,
 *             },
 *             {
 *                 name: "candidate_model",
 *                 entityName: "ads-model",
 *                 entityVersion: "4",
 *                 workloadSize: "Small",
 *                 scaleToZeroEnabled: false,
 *             },
 *         ],
 *         trafficConfig: {
 *             routes: [
 *                 {
 *                     servedModelName: "prod_model",
 *                     trafficPercentage: 90,
 *                 },
 *                 {
 *                     servedModelName: "candidate_model",
 *                     trafficPercentage: 10,
 *                 },
 *             ],
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
