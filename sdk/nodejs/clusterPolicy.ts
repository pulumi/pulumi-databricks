/**
 * This resource creates a cluster policy, which limits the ability to create clusters based on a set of rules. The policy rules limit the attributes or attribute values available for cluster creation. cluster policies have ACLs that limit their use to specific users and groups. Only admin users can create, edit, and delete policies. Admin users also have access to all policies.
 *
 * Cluster policies let you:
 *
 * * Limit users to create clusters with prescribed settings.
 * * Simplify the user interface and enable more users to create their own clusters (by fixing and hiding some values).
 * * Control cost by limiting per cluster maximum cost (by setting limits on attributes whose values contribute to hourly price).
 *
 * Cluster policy permissions limit which policies a user can select in the Policy drop-down when the user creates a cluster:
 *
 * * If no policies have been created in the workspace, the Policy drop-down does not display.
 * * A user who has cluster create permission can select the `Free form` policy and create fully-configurable clusters.
 * * A user who has both cluster create permission and access to cluster policies can select the Free form policy and policies they have access to.
 * * A user that has access to only cluster policies, can select the policies they have access to.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Overriding the built-in cluster policies
 *
 * You can override built-in cluster policies by creating a `databricks.ClusterPolicy` resource with following attributes:
 *
 * * `name` - the name of the built-in cluster policy.
 * * `policyFamilyId` - the ID of the cluster policy family used for built-in cluster policy.
 * * `policyFamilyDefinitionOverrides` - settings to override in the built-in cluster policy.
 *
 * You can obtain the list of defined cluster policies families using the `databricks policy-families list` command of the new [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/index.html), or via [list policy families](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/policyfamilies/list) REST API.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const personalVmOverride = {
 *     autotermination_minutes: {
 *         type: "fixed",
 *         value: 220,
 *         hidden: true,
 *     },
 *     "custom_tags.Team": {
 *         type: "fixed",
 *         value: _var.team,
 *     },
 * };
 * const personalVm = new databricks.ClusterPolicy("personalVm", {
 *     policyFamilyId: "personal-vm",
 *     policyFamilyDefinitionOverrides: JSON.stringify(personal_vm_override),
 * });
 * ```
