/**
 * This resource allows you to manage [Databricks Clusters](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/index.html).
 *
 * > This resource can only be used with a workspace-level provider!
 *
 * > In case of `Cannot access cluster ####-######-####### that was terminated or unpinned more than 30 days ago` errors, please upgrade to v0.5.5 or later. If for some reason you cannot upgrade the version of provider, then the other viable option to unblock the apply pipeline is `terraform state rm path.to.databricks_cluster.resource` command.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const smallest = databricks.getNodeType({
 *     localDisk: true,
 * });
 * const latestLts = databricks.getSparkVersion({
 *     longTermSupport: true,
 * });
 * const sharedAutoscaling = new databricks.Cluster("shared_autoscaling", {
 *     clusterName: "Shared Autoscaling",
 *     sparkVersion: latestLts.then(latestLts => latestLts.id),
 *     nodeTypeId: smallest.then(smallest => smallest.id),
 *     autoterminationMinutes: 20,
 *     autoscale: {
 *         minWorkers: 1,
 *         maxWorkers: 50,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Access Control
 *
 * * databricks.Group and databricks.User can control which groups or individual users can create clusters.
 * * databricks.ClusterPolicy can control which kinds of clusters users can create.
 * * Users, who have access to Cluster Policy, but do not have an `allowClusterCreate` argument set would still be able to create clusters, but within the boundary of the policy.
 * * databricks.Permissions can control which groups or individual users can *Manage*, *Restart* or *Attach to* individual clusters.
 * * `instanceProfileArn` *(AWS only)* can control which data a given cluster can access through cloud-native controls.
 *
