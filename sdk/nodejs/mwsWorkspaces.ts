/**
 * This resource allows you to set up [workspaces on AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/overview.html#e2-architecture-1) or [workspaces on GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings-gcp/workspaces.html). Please follow this complete runnable example on AWS or GCP with new VPC and new workspace setup.
 *
 * > This resource can only be used with an account-level provider!
 *
 * > The `gkeConfig` argument is now deprecated and no longer supported. If you have already created a workspace using these fields, it is safe to remove them from your Pulumi template.
 *
 * > On Azure you need to use azurermDatabricksWorkspace resource to create Azure Databricks workspaces.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Creating a serverless workspace in AWS and GCP
 *
 * Creating a serverless workspace does not require any prerequisite resources. Simply specify `computeMode = "SERVERLESS"` when creating the workspace. Serverless workspaces must not include `credentialsId` or `storageConfigurationId`.
 *
 * On [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/workspace/serverless-workspaces):
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const serverlessWorkspace = new databricks.MwsWorkspaces("serverless_workspace", {
 *     accountId: "",
 *     workspaceName: "serverless-workspace",
 *     awsRegion: "us-east-1",
 *     computeMode: "SERVERLESS",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * On [GCP](https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/en/admin/workspace/serverless-workspaces):
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const serverlessWorkspace = new databricks.MwsWorkspaces("serverless_workspace", {
 *     accountId: "",
 *     workspaceName: "serverless-workspace",
 *     location: "us-east4",
 *     computeMode: "SERVERLESS",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Creating a workspace on AWS
 *
 * !Simplest multiworkspace
 *
 * To get workspace running, you have to configure a couple of things:
 *
 * * databricks.MwsCredentials - You can share a credentials (cross-account IAM role) configuration ID with multiple workspaces. It is not required to create a new one for each workspace.
 * * databricks.MwsStorageConfigurations - You can share a root S3 bucket with multiple workspaces in a single account. You do not have to create new ones for each workspace. If you share a root S3 bucket for multiple workspaces in an account, data on the root S3 bucket is partitioned into separate directories by workspace.
 * * databricks.MwsNetworks - (optional, but recommended) You can share one [customer-managed VPC](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/customer-managed-vpc.html) with multiple workspaces in a single account. However, Databricks recommends using unique subnets and security groups for each workspace. If you plan to share one VPC with multiple workspaces, be sure to size your VPC and subnets accordingly. Because a Databricks databricks.MwsNetworks encapsulates this information, you cannot reuse it across workspaces.
 * * databricks.MwsCustomerManagedKeys - You can share a customer-managed key across workspaces.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const config = new pulumi.Config();
 * // Account ID that can be found in the dropdown under the email address in the upper-right corner of https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/
 * const databricksAccountId = config.requireObject<any>("databricksAccountId");
 * // register cross-account ARN
 * const _this = new databricks.MwsCredentials("this", {
 *     accountId: databricksAccountId,
 *     credentialsName: `${prefix}-creds`,
 *     roleArn: crossaccountArn,
 * });
 * // register root bucket
 * const thisMwsStorageConfigurations = new databricks.MwsStorageConfigurations("this", {
 *     accountId: databricksAccountId,
 *     storageConfigurationName: `${prefix}-storage`,
 *     bucketName: rootBucket,
 * });
 * // register VPC
 * const thisMwsNetworks = new databricks.MwsNetworks("this", {
 *     accountId: databricksAccountId,
 *     networkName: `${prefix}-network`,
 *     vpcId: vpcId,
 *     subnetIds: subnetsPrivate,
 *     securityGroupIds: [securityGroup],
 * });
 * // create workspace in given VPC with DBFS on root bucket
 * const thisMwsWorkspaces = new databricks.MwsWorkspaces("this", {
 *     accountId: databricksAccountId,
 *     workspaceName: prefix,
 *     awsRegion: region,
 *     credentialsId: _this.credentialsId,
 *     storageConfigurationId: thisMwsStorageConfigurations.storageConfigurationId,
 *     networkId: thisMwsNetworks.networkId,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Creating a workspace on AWS with Databricks-Managed VPC
 *
 * ![VPCs](https://docs.databricks.com/_images/customer-managed-vpc.png)
 *
 * By default, Databricks creates a VPC in your AWS account for each workspace. Databricks uses it for running clusters in the workspace. Optionally, you can use your VPC for the workspace, using the feature customer-managed VPC. Databricks recommends that you provide your VPC with databricks.MwsNetworks so that you can configure it according to your organization's enterprise cloud standards while still conforming to Databricks requirements. You cannot migrate an existing workspace to your VPC. Please see the difference described through IAM policy actions [on this page](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-api/iam-role.html).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 * import * as random from "@pulumi/random";
 *
 * const config = new pulumi.Config();
 * // Account Id that could be found in the top right corner of https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/

 * const naming = new random.index.String("naming", {
 *     special: false,
 *     upper: false,
 *     length: 6,
 * });
 * const prefix = `dltp${naming.result}`;
 * const _this = databricks.getAwsAssumeRolePolicy({
 *     externalId: databricksAccountId,
 * });
 * const crossAccountRole = new aws.index.IamRole("cross_account_role", {
 *     name: `${prefix}-crossaccount`,
 *     assumeRolePolicy: _this.json,
 *     tags: tags,
 * });
 * const thisGetAwsCrossAccountPolicy = databricks.getAwsCrossAccountPolicy({});
 * const thisIamRolePolicy = new aws.index.IamRolePolicy("this", {
 *     name: `${prefix}-policy`,
 *     role: crossAccountRole.id,
 *     policy: thisGetAwsCrossAccountPolicy.json,
 * });
 * const thisMwsCredentials = new databricks.MwsCredentials("this", {
 *     accountId: databricksAccountId,
 *     credentialsName: `${prefix}-creds`,
 *     roleArn: crossAccountRole.arn,
 * });
 * const rootStorageBucket = new aws.index.S3Bucket("root_storage_bucket", {
 *     bucket: `${prefix}-rootbucket`,
 *     acl: "private",
 *     forceDestroy: true,
 *     tags: tags,
 * });
 * const rootVersioning = new aws.index.S3BucketVersioning("root_versioning", {
 *     bucket: rootStorageBucket.id,
 *     versioningConfiguration: [{
 *         status: "Disabled",
 *     }],
 * });
 * const rootStorageBucketS3BucketServerSideEncryptionConfiguration = new aws.index.S3BucketServerSideEncryptionConfiguration("root_storage_bucket", {
 *     bucket: rootStorageBucket.bucket,
 *     rule: [{
 *         applyServerSideEncryptionByDefault: [{
 *             sseAlgorithm: "AES256",
 *         }],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const rootStorageBucketS3BucketPublicAccessBlock = new aws.index.S3BucketPublicAccessBlock("root_storage_bucket", {
 *     bucket: rootStorageBucket.id,
 *     blockPublicAcls: true,
 *     blockPublicPolicy: true,
 *     ignorePublicAcls: true,
 *     restrictPublicBuckets: true,
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [rootStorageBucket],
 * });
 * const thisGetAwsBucketPolicy = databricks.getAwsBucketPolicy({
 *     bucket: rootStorageBucket.bucket,
 * });
 * const rootBucketPolicy = new aws.index.S3BucketPolicy("root_bucket_policy", {
 *     bucket: rootStorageBucket.id,
 *     policy: thisGetAwsBucketPolicy.json,
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [rootStorageBucketS3BucketPublicAccessBlock],
 * });
 * const thisMwsStorageConfigurations = new databricks.MwsStorageConfigurations("this", {
 *     accountId: databricksAccountId,
 *     storageConfigurationName: `${prefix}-storage`,
 *     bucketName: rootStorageBucket.bucket,
 * });
 * const thisMwsWorkspaces = new databricks.MwsWorkspaces("this", {

 *     customTags: {
 *         SoldToCode: "1234",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * In order to create a [Databricks Workspace that leverages AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/privatelink.html) please ensure that you have read and understood the [Enable Private Link](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/privatelink.html) documentation and then customise the example above with the relevant examples from mws_vpc_endpoint, mwsPrivateAccessSettings and mws_networks.
 *
 * ### Creating a workspace on GCP
 *
 * To get workspace running, you have to configure a network object:
 *
 * * databricks.MwsNetworks - (optional, but recommended) You can share one [customer-managed VPC](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/gcp/customer-managed-vpc.html) with multiple workspaces in a single account. You do not have to create a new VPC for each workspace. However, you cannot reuse subnets with other resources, including other workspaces or non-Databricks resources. If you plan to share one VPC with multiple workspaces, be sure to size your VPC and subnets accordingly. Because a Databricks databricks.MwsNetworks encapsulates this information, you cannot reuse it across workspaces.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const config = new pulumi.Config();
 * // Account Id that could be found in the top right corner of https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/
 * const databricksAccountId = config.requireObject<any>("databricksAccountId");
 * const databricksGoogleServiceAccount = config.requireObject<any>("databricksGoogleServiceAccount");
 * const googleProject = config.requireObject<any>("googleProject");
 * // register VPC
 * const _this = new databricks.MwsNetworks("this", {
 *     accountId: databricksAccountId,
 *     networkName: `${prefix}-network`,
 *     gcpNetworkInfo: {
 *         networkProjectId: googleProject,
 *         vpcId: vpcId,
 *         subnetId: subnetId,
 *         subnetRegion: subnetRegion,
 *         podIpRangeName: "pods",
 *         serviceIpRangeName: "svc",
 *     },
 * });
 * // create workspace in given VPC
 * const thisMwsWorkspaces = new databricks.MwsWorkspaces("this", {
 *     accountId: databricksAccountId,
 *     workspaceName: prefix,
 *     location: subnetRegion,
 *     cloudResourceContainer: {
 *         gcp: {
 *             projectId: googleProject,
 *         },
 *     },
 *     networkId: _this.networkId,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * In order to create a [Databricks Workspace that leverages GCP Private Service Connect](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/gcp/private-service-connect.html) please ensure that you have read and understood the [Enable Private Service Connect](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/gcp/private-service-connect.html) documentation and then customise the example above with the relevant examples from mws_vpc_endpoint, mwsPrivateAccessSettings and mws_networks.
