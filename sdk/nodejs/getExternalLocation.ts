 *
 * Getting details of an existing external location in the metastore
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const this = databricks.getExternalLocation({

 * ```
 *
 * ## Related Resources
 *
 * The following resources are used in the same context:
 *
 * * databricks.getExternalLocations to get names of all external locations
 * * databricks.ExternalLocation to manage external locations within Unity Catalog.
