/**
 * Allows you to create a private endpoint in a Network Connectivity Config that can be used to [configure private connectivity from serverless compute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/network/serverless-network-security/serverless-private-link).
 *
 * > This resource can only be used with an account-level provider!
 *
 * > This feature is available on Azure, and in Public Preview on AWS.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Create private endpoints to an Azure storage account and an Azure standard load balancer.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const config = new pulumi.Config();
 * const region = config.requireObject<any>("region");
 * const prefix = config.requireObject<any>("prefix");
 * const ncc = new databricks.MwsNetworkConnectivityConfig("ncc", {
 *     name: `ncc-for-${prefix}`,
 *     region: region,
 * });
 * const storage = new databricks.MwsNccPrivateEndpointRule("storage", {
 *     networkConnectivityConfigId: ncc.networkConnectivityConfigId,
 *     resourceId: "/subscriptions/653bb673-1234-abcd-a90b-d064d5d53ca4/resourcegroups/example-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/examplesa",
 *     groupId: "blob",
 * });
 * const slb = new databricks.MwsNccPrivateEndpointRule("slb", {
 *     networkConnectivityConfigId: ncc.networkConnectivityConfigId,
 *     resourceId: "/subscriptions/653bb673-1234-abcd-a90b-d064d5d53ca4/resourcegroups/example-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Network/privatelinkServices/example-private-link-service",
 *     domainNames: ["my-example.exampledomain.com"],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Create a private endpoint rule to an AWS VPC endpoint and to an S3 bucket.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const config = new pulumi.Config();
 * const region = config.requireObject<any>("region");
 * const prefix = config.requireObject<any>("prefix");
 * const ncc = new databricks.MwsNetworkConnectivityConfig("ncc", {
 *     name: `ncc-for-${prefix}`,
 *     region: region,
 * });
 * const storage = new databricks.MwsNccPrivateEndpointRule("storage", {
 *     networkConnectivityConfigId: ncc.networkConnectivityConfigId,
 *     endpointService: "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3",
 *     resourceNames: ["bucket"],
 * });
 * const vpce = new databricks.MwsNccPrivateEndpointRule("vpce", {
 *     networkConnectivityConfigId: ncc.networkConnectivityConfigId,
 *     endpointService: "com.amazonaws.vpce.us-west-2.vpce-svc-xyz",
 *     domainNames: ["subdomain.internal.net"],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Related Resources
 *
 * The following resources are used in the context:
 *
 * * databricks.MwsNetworkConnectivityConfig to create Network Connectivity Config objects.
 * * databricks.MwsNccBinding to attach an NCC to a workspace.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * This resource can be imported by Databricks account ID and Network Connectivity Config ID.
 *
 * hcl
 *
 * import {
 *
 *   to = databricks_mws_ncc_private_endpoint_rule.this
 *
 *   id = "<network_connectivity_config_id>/<rule_id>"
 *
 * }
 *
 * Alternatively, when using `terraform` version 1.4 or earlier, import using the `pulumi import` command:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import databricks:index/mwsNccPrivateEndpointRule:MwsNccPrivateEndpointRule this "<network_connectivity_config_id>/<rule_id>"
 * ```
