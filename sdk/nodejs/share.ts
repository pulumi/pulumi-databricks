/**
 * > **Note** This resource could be only used with workspace-level provider!
 *
 * In Delta Sharing, a share is a read-only collection of tables and table partitions that a provider wants to share with one or more recipients. If your recipient uses a Unity Catalog-enabled Databricks workspace, you can also include notebook files, views (including dynamic views that restrict access at the row and column level), Unity Catalog volumes, and Unity Catalog models in a share.
 *
 * In a Unity Catalog-enabled Databricks workspace, a share is a securable object registered in Unity Catalog. A `databricks.Share` is contained within a databricks_metastore. If you remove a share from your Unity Catalog metastore, all recipients of that share lose the ability to access it.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * > **Note** In Pulumi configuration, it is recommended to define objects in alphabetical order of their `name` arguments, so that you get consistent and readable diff. Whenever objects are added or removed, or `name` is renamed, you'll observe a change in the majority of tasks. It's related to the fact that the current version of the provider treats `object` blocks as an ordered list. Alternatively, `object` block could have been an unordered set, though end-users would see the entire block replaced upon a change in single property of the task.
 *
 * Creating a Delta Sharing share and add some existing tables to it
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const things = databricks.getTables({
 *     catalogName: "sandbox",
 *     schemaName: "things",
 * });
 * const some = new databricks.Share("some", {
 *     objects: .map(entry => ({
 *         name: entry.value,
 *         dataObjectType: "TABLE",
 *     })),
 *     name: "my_share",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Creating a Delta Sharing share and add a schema to it(including all current and future tables).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const schemaShare = new databricks.Share("schema_share", {
 *     name: "schema_share",
 *     objects: [{
 *         name: "catalog_name.schema_name",
 *         dataObjectType: "SCHEMA",
 *         historyDataSharingStatus: "ENABLED",
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Creating a Delta Sharing share and share a table with partitions spec and history
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const some = new databricks.Share("some", {
 *     name: "my_share",
 *     objects: [{
 *         name: "my_catalog.my_schema.my_table",
 *         dataObjectType: "TABLE",
 *         historyDataSharingStatus: "ENABLED",
 *         partitions: [
 *             {
 *                 values: [
 *                     {
 *                         name: "year",
 *                         op: "EQUAL",
 *                         value: "2009",
 *                     },
 *                     {
 *                         name: "month",
 *                         op: "EQUAL",
 *                         value: "12",
 *                     },
 *                 ],
 *             },
 *             {
 *                 values: [{
 *                     name: "year",
 *                     op: "EQUAL",
 *                     value: "2010",
 *                 }],
 *             },
 *         ],
 *     }],
 * });
