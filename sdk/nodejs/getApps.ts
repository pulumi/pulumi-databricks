/**
 * > This data source can only be used with a workspace-level provider!
 *
 * > This feature is in [Public Preview](https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/release-types.html).
 *
 * [Databricks Apps](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/index.html) run directly on a customer’s Databricks instance, integrate with their data, use and extend Databricks services, and enable users to interact through single sign-on. This resource creates the application but does not handle app deployment, which should be handled separately as part of your CI/CD pipeline.
 *
 * This data source allows you to fetch information about all Databricks Apps within a workspace.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const allApps = databricks.getApps({});
 * ```
 *
