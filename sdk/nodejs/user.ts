/**
 * This resource allows you to manage [users in Databricks Workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/users.html), [Databricks Account Console](https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/) or [Azure Databricks Account Console](https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net). You can also associate Databricks users to databricks_group. Upon user creation the user will receive a welcome email. You can also get information about caller identity using databricks.getCurrentUser data source.
 *
 * > This resource can be used with an account or workspace-level provider.
 *
 * > To assign account level users to workspace use databricks_mws_permission_assignment.
 *
 * > Entitlements, like, `allowClusterCreate`, `allowInstancePoolCreate`, `databricksSqlAccess`, `workspaceAccess` applicable only for workspace-level users.  Use databricks.Entitlements resource to assign entitlements inside a workspace to account-level users.
 *
 * To create users in the Databricks account, the provider must be configured with `host = "https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com"` on AWS deployments or `host = "https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net"` and authenticate using AAD tokens on Azure deployments.
 *
 * The default behavior when deleting a `databricks.User` resource depends on whether the provider is configured at the workspace-level or account-level. When the provider is configured at the workspace-level, the user will be deleted from the workspace. When the provider is configured at the account-level, the user will be deactivated but not deleted. When the provider is configured at the account level, to delete the user from the account when the resource is deleted, set `disableAsUserDeletion = false`. Conversely, when the provider is configured at the account-level, to deactivate the user when the resource is deleted, set `disableAsUserDeletion = true`.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Creating regular user:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const me = new databricks.User("me", {userName: "me@example.com"});
 * ```
 *
 * Creating user with administrative permissions - referencing special `admins` databricks.Group in databricks.GroupMember resource:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const admins = databricks.getGroup({
 *     displayName: "admins",
 * });
 * const me = new databricks.User("me", {userName: "me@example.com"});
 * const i_am_admin = new databricks.GroupMember("i-am-admin", {
 *     groupId: admins.then(admins => admins.id),
 *     memberId: me.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Creating user with cluster create permissions:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const me = new databricks.User("me", {
 *     userName: "me@example.com",
 *     displayName: "Example user",
 *     allowClusterCreate: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Creating user in AWS Databricks account:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const accountUser = new databricks.User("account_user", {
 *     userName: "me@example.com",
 *     displayName: "Example user",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Creating user in Azure Databricks account:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const accountUser = new databricks.User("account_user", {
 *     userName: "me@example.com",
 *     displayName: "Example user",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Related Resources
 *
 * The following resources are often used in the same context:
 *
 * * End to end workspace management guide.
 * * databricks.Group to manage [groups in Databricks Workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/groups.html) or [Account Console](https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/) (for AWS deployments).
 * * databricks.Group data to retrieve information about databricks.Group members, entitlements and instance profiles.
 * * databricks.GroupInstanceProfile to attach databricks.InstanceProfile (AWS) to databricks_group.
 * * databricks.GroupMember to attach users and groups as group members.
 * * databricks.InstanceProfile to manage AWS EC2 instance profiles that users can launch databricks.Cluster and access data, like databricks_mount.
 * * databricks.User data to retrieve information about databricks_user.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * The resource scim user can be imported using id:
 *
 * bash
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import databricks:index/user:User me <user-id>
