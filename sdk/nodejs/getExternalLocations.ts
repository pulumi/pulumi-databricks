 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * List all external locations in the metastore
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const all = databricks.getExternalLocations({});

 * ```
 *
 * ## Related Resources
 *
 * The following resources are used in the same context:
 *
 * * databricks.ExternalLocation to get information about a single external location
 * * databricks.ExternalLocation to manage external locations within Unity Catalog.
