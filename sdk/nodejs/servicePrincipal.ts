/**
 * Directly manage [Service Principals](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html) that could be added to databricks.Group in Databricks account or workspace.
 *
 * > This resource can be used with an account or workspace-level provider.
 *
 * There are different types of service principals:
 *
 * * Databricks-managed - exists only inside the Databricks platform (all clouds) and couldn't be used for accessing non-Databricks services.
 * * Azure-managed - existing Azure service principal (enterprise application) is registered inside Databricks.  It could be used to work with other Azure services.
 *
 * > To assign account level service principals to workspace use databricks_mws_permission_assignment.
 *
 * > Entitlements, like, `allowClusterCreate`, `allowInstancePoolCreate`, `databricksSqlAccess`, `workspaceAccess`, `workspace-consume` applicable only for workspace-level service principals. Use databricks.Entitlements resource to assign entitlements inside a workspace to account-level service principals.
 *
 * The default behavior when deleting a `databricks.ServicePrincipal` resource depends on whether the provider is configured at the workspace-level or account-level. When the provider is configured at the workspace-level, the service principal will be deleted from the workspace. When the provider is configured at the account-level, the service principal will be deactivated but not deleted. When the provider is configured at the account level, to delete the service principal from the account when the resource is deleted, set `disableAsUserDeletion = false`. Conversely, when the provider is configured at the account-level, to deactivate the service principal when the resource is deleted, set `disableAsUserDeletion = true`.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Creating regular Databricks-managed service principal:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const sp = new databricks.ServicePrincipal("sp", {displayName: "Admin SP"});
 * ```
 *
 * Creating service principal with administrative permissions - referencing special `admins` databricks.Group in databricks.GroupMember resource:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const admins = databricks.getGroup({
 *     displayName: "admins",
 * });
 * const sp = new databricks.ServicePrincipal("sp", {displayName: "Admin SP"});
 * const i_am_admin = new databricks.GroupMember("i-am-admin", {
 *     groupId: admins.then(admins => admins.id),
 *     memberId: sp.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Creating Azure-managed service principal with cluster create permissions:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const sp = new databricks.ServicePrincipal("sp", {
 *     applicationId: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
 *     displayName: "Example service principal",
 *     allowClusterCreate: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Creating Databricks-managed service principal in AWS Databricks account:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const sp = new databricks.ServicePrincipal("sp", {displayName: "Automation-only SP"});
 * ```
 *
 * Creating Azure-managed service principal in Azure Databricks account:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as databricks from "@pulumi/databricks";
 *
 * const sp = new databricks.ServicePrincipal("sp", {applicationId: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Related Resources
 *
 * The following resources are often used in the same context:
 *
 * * End to end workspace management guide.
 * * databricks.Group to manage [groups in Databricks Workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/groups.html) or [Account Console](https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/) (for AWS deployments).
 * * databricks.Group data to retrieve information about databricks.Group members, entitlements and instance profiles.
 * * databricks.GroupMember to attach users and groups as group members.
 * * databricks.Permissions to manage [access control](https://docs.databricks.com/security/access-control/index.html) in Databricks workspace.
 * * databricks.SqlPermissions to manage data object access control lists in Databricks workspaces for things like tables, views, databases, and more to manage secrets for the service principal (only for AWS deployments)
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * The resource scim service principal can be imported using its SCIM id, for example `2345678901234567`. To get the service principal ID, call [Get service principals](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/scim/scim-sp.html#get-service-principals).
 *
 * hcl
 *
 * import {
 *
 *   to = databricks_service_principal.me
 *
 *   id = "<service-principal-id>"
 *
 * }
 *
 * Alternatively, when using `terraform` version 1.4 or earlier, import using the `pulumi import` command:
 *
 * bash
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import databricks:index/servicePrincipal:ServicePrincipal me <service-principal-id>
 * ```
